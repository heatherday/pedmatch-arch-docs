COG Institution Patient Registration and Enrollment on APEC1621 (master protocol) (system OPEN)
  messgae to MATCHBOX COG registration number
  BPC receives email notification of enrollment to Peds MATCH
  Institution submits Peds MATCH Specimen Transmittal Notes to self: (need to review) could implement screening question Y/N
  Specimens are shipped from institution(s) 
(check if email notification to sequencing labs/MDA)
BPC Day 1
1)	BPC receives blood and tumor block (FFPE).
a.	Blood in EDTA
b.	Blood in Streck
c.	Paraffin Block Primary/Metastatic or Unstained Primary/Metastatic Slides
2)	BPC accessioned specimens in STARS. 
3)	BPC send specimens to CM and MGL for processing. (in STARS - checkpoint - specimen ownership
a.	Blood in EDTA to MGL
b.	Tumor block to CM 
i.	BPC will look at tissue and create request to cut 30 slides (larger tissues) or 50 slides (smaller tissue).  CM will make final judgment and will contact BPC is the request needs to be updated.
4)	BPC process blood in streck for plasma > bank
5)	MGL extracts DNA from blood specimens.
a.	QC specimens (run get/run pico), create aliquots > bank (completed in STARS?) cause for failure? 
6)	Core Morph Lab cuts slide from tumor block (FFPE)
  	          Cuts = 1 HE, 4 unstained (from IHC), 30-50 unstained slides, 1 H&E
              Slides for IHC do not need to be vacuum sealed or wax dipped
7)	BPC picks up tumor block, stained slides and slides 4 unstained slides (for IHC)
a.	All specimens will be shipped back to BPC in STARS.  BPC will need to make a new request that have the unstained slides.
8)	BPC takes slides to Pathologist for review and slide annotation.
a.	Call/page Dr. Arnold when receive
b.	Review sheet will need to be created at some time. 
c.	If low percent tumor, sent email out to group > do not move on.
d.	If not concordant, send email out to group > do not move on.
9)	BPC takes HE annotated slides back to CM for macro dissection.
a.	BPC will send a CM request in STARS that has the stained slides and unstained slides.
10)	BPC enters path review forms into STARS.
11)	Core Morph scrapes the tumor section of the slides into a vial.  
a.	Completed CM request in STARS.
12)	BPC picks up stained slides and vial of scrapings.
a.	BPC will receive CM request and create a MGL request in STARS.
13)	BPC sends vial of scrapings to MGL.
14)	BPC sends annotated stained slides to VM.

Day 2
15)	BPC coordinator receives paperwork from the previous day and QC specimens in STARS.
          	Received message triggered to MATCHBOX, PatientID, Surgical ID, Specimen Type..... you are here 
b.	Surgical event ID assigned to tumor specimen.
16)	VM scans slides.
a.	Slides will first be scanned with the annotation, and then the annotations will be removed and rescanned. 
17)	BPC sends slides for IHC to MD Anderson. 
a.	A shipped message will be triggered to Match Box. 
b.	These should not be shipped until
18)	VM sends images to MD Anderson.
a.	Sends stained slides to BPC.
19)	MGL extracts DNA and RNA from paraffin scrapings. 

Day 3
20)	MGL will create cDNA and run QC on all nucleic acid specimens.
a.	Run gel, run pico
b.	Make DNA dilutions and aliquots
c.	Run agilent
d.	Run nanodrop
21)	MGL director performs review of nucleic acid specimens.
22)	Create shipment in STARS > assign specimens.
a.	Molecular ID is assigned.
23)	Relabel specimen vials with sequencing center requirements.
a.	Molecular ID in 2D barcode
24)	MGL physically ships and marks shipment in STARS as shipped.
a.	Shipped message triggered to match box.
25)	MGL runs identity panel on tumor and blood specimens.
a.	Due to timing this will probably occur after specimens have been shipped. 
26)	BPC banks slides.
